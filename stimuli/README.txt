The pictures were photographs of natural scenes (Corel CD-ROM library; 
images available for viewing on the download page). The images of each 
category were chosen to be as varied as possible. The animal category 
included pictures of mammals, birds, fishes, arthropods, and reptiles. 
There was no a priori information about the size, position or number of 
the targets in a single photograph. There were also a wide range of 
non-target images, with outdoor and indoor scenes, natural landscapes or 
city scenes, pictures of food, fruits, vegetables, trees and flowers... 
In the categorization task, 500 distractors and 500 targets were seen by 
every subject but randomly distributed among all 10 series. In the 
recognition task, 750 distrators and 210 target photographs were used 
(15 target photographs per subject). Target photographs were chosen 
according to the results of a previous study (Fabre-Thorpe et al., 2001). 
The first group of 70 images (5 per subjects) was composed of the animal 
images out of 1000 which were correctly categorized by all subjects and 
were associated with the fastest RTs). The second group of 70 images was 
composed of animal images which had the lowest accuracy and associated with
the longest RTs). In the last group, pictures contained no animal, i.e. 
these pictures were distractors of the categorization task.
