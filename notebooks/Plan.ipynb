    "# Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "Post GitHub project that covers the following EEG data analysis results\n",
    "\n",
    "- Before preprocessing and after preprocessing comparison on\n",
    "    - channels where there is significant ERP difference between conditions\n",
    "    - Before-and-after pre-processing comparison of absolute SNR and Cohen’s d\n",
    "- ERP plots and data presentation that highly resemble those of the study.\n",
    "- Have all of these results clearly showcased on my GitHub project.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "Will select 10 subjects with normal level noise on the 'Raw Data Quality Assessment’ in pre-processing stage. \n",
    "\n",
    "ICA and artifact rejection will be performed on data of only 1 subjects. Autumated ICA approach will be used for the remaining 9 subjects. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Notebook roles:** `02a_manual_ica_single_session.ipynb` handles the one-off manual ICA pass for the designated subject, while `02b_automated_ica_batch.ipynb` is the official third notebook in the run order and processes the remaining subjects with ICLabel + ARTIST, exporting QC metrics and summaries for GitHub.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Manual subject data inventory:**\n",
    "> - **sub-001 (legacy test subject):** `data/preprocessed/after_rereferencing/sub-001/ses-0X/sub-001_ses-0X_run-*_preprocessed_after_rereferencing.fif` → cleaned copies under `data/preprocessed/after_ica/sub-001/.../sub-001_ses-0X_run-*_preprocessed_ica_cleaned.fif`.\n",
    "> - **sub-003 (current manual ICA subject):** per `02a`, each session lives under its own directory:\n",
    ">   - Session 1: `data/preprocessed/after_rereferencing/sub-003/ses-01/sub-003_ses-01_run-*_preprocessed_after_rereferencing.fif` and cleaned versions `data/preprocessed/after_ica/sub-003/ses-01/sub-003_ses-01_run-*_preprocessed_ica_cleaned.fif`, plus the annotated aggregate `sub-003_ses-01_preprocessed_ica_cleaned_annotated.fif`.\n",
    ">   - Session 2: same naming in `.../sub-003/ses-02/...` (e.g., `sub-003_ses-02_run-1_preprocessed_after_rereferencing.fif`, `sub-003_ses-02_run-1_preprocessed_ica_cleaned.fif`).\n",
    "> - Keep sessions separate when saving; use the notebook helper’s merge step whenever we need a single continuous Raw object for Cohen’s d / SNR QC.\n",

    "## Guide on Local Run\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Install Dependencies**:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    bash\n",
    "    \n",
    "    `cd \"C:\\Users\\mints\\Documents\\EEG\"\n",
    "    pip install -r requirements.txt`\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. **Run Notebooks in Sequence**:\n",

    "    - `01_preprocessing_pipeline.ipynb` - Quality assessment and preprocessing\n",
    "    - `02_manual_ica_review.ipynb` - Manual ICA and artifact rejection\n",
    "    - Continue with ERP analysis\n",
    "3. **Review Manual ICA Results**:\n",
    "    - The code will identify the best subject for manual ICA review\n",
    "    - Interactive plots will guide component rejection decisions\n",
    "4. **Generate Final Results**:\n",
    "    - Publication-quality ERP plots\n",

    "## Troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Issues and Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **NameError: name 'plot_component_comprehensive' is not defined**\n",
    "- **Cause**: Missing import in Cell 2 of `02_manual_ica_review.ipynb`\n",
    "- **Solution**: Ensure Cell 2 contains: `from utils.ica_plotting import plot_component_comprehensive`\n",
    "- **Prevention**: Always verify imports when modifying the notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Interactive GUI shows wrong number of components**\n",
    "- **Cause**: ICA component count not set to 50\n",
    "- **Solution**: Ensure Cell 10 contains: `n_components = min(50, len(raw_ica.ch_names) - 1)`\n",
    "- **Note**: Actual component count may be limited by available channels\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Component previews appear before Interactive GUI**\n",
    "- **Cause**: Sections 6 and 6B contain plotting code\n",
    "- **Solution**: Remove `ica.plot_components()` and `ica.plot_properties()` calls from these sections\n",
    "- **Correct behavior**: Sections 6 and 6B should only show instructions and variance info\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **NameError: name 'bad_categories' is not defined**\n",
    "- **Cause**: Missing `bad_categories` variable definition in Interactive GUI\n",
    "- **Solution**: Ensure Interactive GUI contains: `bad_categories = ['Muscle', 'Eye', 'Line', 'Channel', 'Other']`\n",
    "- **Prevention**: Always verify variable definitions when modifying Interactive GUI code\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Export Summary doesn't update bad_components in Section 7**\n",
    "- **Cause**: Missing `global bad_components` declaration in export function\n",
    "- **Solution**: The export function now uses `global bad_components` to automatically update the variable\n",
    "- **How it works**: After clicking \"Export Summary\", Section 7 will automatically use the categorized components\n",
    "- **Manual override**: You can still manually set `bad_components = [...]` in Section 7 if needed\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Section 9 shows inline image instead of interactive GUI window**\n",
    "- **Cause**: Matplotlib backend is set to inline mode (default in Jupyter)\n",
    "- **Solution**: Run the cell with `%matplotlib qt` **before** running Section 9\n",
    "- **Step-by-step**:\n",
    "  1. There's a dedicated cell before Section 9 with backend switching code\n",
    "  2. Run that cell first to enable interactive backend\n",
    "  3. Then run Section 9 - a GUI window should open\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **ImportError: Failed to import any Qt binding modules**\n",
    "- **Cause**: PyQt5 (or other Qt bindings) not installed\n",
    "- **Solution**: Install PyQt5 in your terminal:\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  pip3 install PyQt5\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **Alternative backends**:\n",
    "  - TkAgg: Usually comes with Python (use `%matplotlib tk`)\n",
    "  - ipympl: Install with `pip3 install ipympl` (use `%matplotlib widget`)\n",
    "- **Note**: The backend-switching cell will automatically try Qt first, then Tk as fallback\n",
    "- **Headless environment**: If running on a server without display, you'll need X11 forwarding or use automated detection instead\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Can't drag to mark bad segments in Section 9 GUI**\n",
    "- **Cause**: MNE's annotation mode is not automatically active\n",
    "- **Solution - Method 1 (Interactive)**:\n",
    "  1. In the plot window, look for the **'Annotate' button** or toolbar\n",
    "  2. Click it to enable annotation mode\n",
    "  3. OR right-click on the plot → select annotation option\n",
    "  4. Then click and drag to select time ranges\n",
    "  5. Choose 'BAD' from the annotation menu\n",
    "- **Solution - Method 2 (Automated)**:\n",
    "  - Use Section 9A (Alternative) for automated bad segment detection\n",
    "  - Based on amplitude thresholds (default: 150 µV)\n",
    "  - Automatically marks segments exceeding threshold\n",
    "  - Can still review in interactive plot afterward\n",
    "- **Controls in interactive plot**:\n",
    "  - Arrow keys ← → to navigate through time\n",
    "  - +/- keys to zoom in/out\n",
    "  - Press 'h' to see all keyboard shortcuts\n",
