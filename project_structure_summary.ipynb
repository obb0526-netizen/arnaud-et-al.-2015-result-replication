    "## Notebook Purposes\n",
    "\n",
    "- **main_analysis.ipynb** – Final presentation notebook; loads processed outputs, recomputes key stats (SME, ERP contrasts) under the updated ROI definition, and produces figures/tables for GitHub.\n",
    "- **notebooks/00_quality_assessment_and_subjects_selection.ipynb** – Raw-data QC dashboard; ranks participants, visualizes noise metrics, and writes the `preprocessing_summary.csv`/selection lists that downstream steps use.\n",
    "- **notebooks/01_preprocessing_pipeline.ipynb** – Entry point for running the preprocessing stack; orchestrates subject selection, filtering, re-referencing, and hands off to the automation helpers in `src/preprocessing/` for ICA + artifact rejection.\n",
    "- **notebooks/02a_manual_ica_single_session.ipynb** – Walkthrough for the single manually curated subject (currently `sub-003`); includes ICA inspection, component tagging, bad-segment annotation, and exports cleaned FIF files.\n",
    "- **notebooks/02b_automated_ica_batch.ipynb** – Batch pipeline for the remaining subjects; merges runs, applies ICLabel-based ICA rejection plus AutoReject epoch cleaning, and logs per-session QC metrics.\n",
    "- **notebooks/03_erp_analysis.ipynb** – Performs epoching, statistical tests (ERP familiarity, repetition, category effects), and writes the CSV outputs consumed by `main_analysis.ipynb`.\n"
